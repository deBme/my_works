Hi,
This is a simple login page (validation of the username and password).It will validate the username if it only 
has alphabetic charaters  and for password there should be atleast one uppercase one lowercase and one numeric
 value, the length of the password should be in between 6 to 32.

You can change it according to your requirement in the javascript file.
I have used css3 so for better result use a modern browser like Google Chrome.
